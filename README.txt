The "Photos Of This Name" app lets a user search for a name or import a contact name from their contact list and gets the images in which that name has been tagged recently on Flickr. Along with the image, the user also gets the owner's name of the photo, the date taken and a description on the photo if available. The user can click on any row to see an enlarged version of the photo in the browser. The app handles various validation cases such as:
- if the user doesn't enter anything and clicks search, a Toast is displayed telling user to enter a name
- if there is no description for any photo, it displays no description available
- there is a default photo of no photo available that gets set if there is no small version of the photo
- if there are no results found, it alerts the user about the same and lets them go back to the main page
- while the xml data is being parsed, the user can cancel it and go back to the main page
- if there is no internet connection, it prompts the user that there is no internet connection and disables the search button preventing the user from searching from anything.
